# Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App

## By FreeCodeCamp

> HTML tags give a webpage its structure. You can use HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpage.

- [codepen link](https://codepen.io/manujgogoi/pen/KKQQKPd)

## Step 1

HTML elements have opening tags like `<h1>` and closing tags like `</h1>`.

Find the `h1` element and change the text between its opening and closing tags to say CatPhotoApp.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 2

The `h1` to `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Add an `h2` element below the `h1` element that says Cat Photos.

```html
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
```

## Step 3

Paragraph (`p`) elements are used to create paragraph text on websites.

Create a paragraph (`p`) element below your `h2` element, and give it the text `Click here to view more cat photos.`

```html
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
<p>Click here to view more cat photos</p>
```

## Step 4

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with `<!--`, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with `-->`. For example, the comment `<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->` contains the text `TODO: Remove h1`.

Add a comment above the `p` element with the text `TODO: Add link to cat photos`.

```html
<!--TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
```

## Step 5

HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO) and **accessibility**.

Identify the main section of this page by adding a `<main>` opening tag after the `h1` element, and a `</main>` closing tag after the `p` element.

```html
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<main>
  <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
  <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
  <p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
</main>
```

## Step 6

HTML elements are often nested within other HTML elements. In the previous step you nested the `h2` element, comment and `p` element within the `main` element. A nested element is a child of its parent element.

To make HTML easier to read, indent the `h2` element, the comment, and `p` element exactly two spaces to indicate they are children of the main element.

## Step 7

You can add images to your website by using the `img` element. `img` elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a **_self-closing tag_**.

Add an `img` element below the `p` element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

```html
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
<img />
```

## Step 8

HTML **_attributes_** are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The `src` attribute in an `img` element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). An example of an img element using an src attribute: `<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">`.

Add an `src` attribute to the existing `img` element that is set to the following URL: `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg.`

```html
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
/>
```

## Step 9

All `img` elements should have an `alt` attribute. The `alt` attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">` has an `alt` attribute with the text `A cat`.

Add an `alt` attribute to the `img` element with the text `A cute orange cat lying on its back`.

```html
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
  alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back"
/>
```

## Step 10

You can link to another page with the anchor (`a`) element. For example, `<a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a>` would link to `freecodecamp.org`.

Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to `https://freecatphotoapp.com`. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.

```html
<a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"></a>
```

## Step 11

A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (`a`) element. For example, `<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a>` is a link with the text `click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org`.

Add the anchor text `cat photos` to the anchor element. This will become the link's text.

```html
<a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>
```

## Step 12

Turn the words `cat photos` located inside `p` element into a link by replacing the words with the anchor element added previously. The `p` element should show the same text in the browser, but the words `cat photos` should now be a link. There should only be one link showing in the app.

```html
<p>
  Click here to view more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>.
</p>
```

## Step 13

Add a `target` attribute with the value `_blank` to the anchor (`a`) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.

```html
<p>
  Click here to view more
  <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>.
</p>
```

## Step 14

Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. Use `https://freecatphotoapp.com` as the anchor's `href` attribute value.

```html
<a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"
  ><img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
    alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
/></a>
```

## Step 15

Before adding any new content, you should make use of a `section` element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.

Take all the elements currently located within the `main` element and nest them in a `section` element.

```html
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>
      Click here to view more
      <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>.
    </p>
    <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"
      ><img
        src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
        alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
    /></a>
  </section>
</main>
```

## Step 16

It is time to add a new `section`. Add a second `section` element below the existing `section` element.

## Step 17

Within the second `section` element, add a new `h2` element with the text `Cat Lists`.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
</section>
```

## Step 18

When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.

After the last `h2` element of the second `section` element, add an `h3` element with the text `Things cats love:`.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
  <h3>Things cats love:</h3>
</section>
```

## Step 19

After the `h3` element with the `Things cats love:` text, add an **unordered list** (`ul`) element. Note that nothing will be displayed at this point.

## Step 20

Use list item (`li`) elements to create items in a list. Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

Nest three list items within the `ul` element to display three things cats love: `cat nip`, `laser pointers` and `lasagna`.

## Step 21

After the unordered list, add a new image with an `src` attribute value set to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg` and an `alt` attribute value set to `A slice of lasagna on a plate.`

```html
<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg"
  alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."
/>
```

## Step 22

The `figure` element represents **_self-contained content_** and will allow you to **_associate an image with a caption_**.

Nest the image you just added within a `figure` element.

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg"
    alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."
  />
</figure>
```

## Step 23

A figure caption (`figcaption`) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the `figure` element. For example, `<figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption>` adds the caption `A cute cat`.

After the image nested in the `figure` element, add a `figcaption` element with the text `Cats love lasagna.`

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg"
    alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."
  />
  <figcaption>Cats love lasagna.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Step 24

Emphasize the word `love` in the `figcaption` element by wrapping it in an emphasis (`em`) element.

```html
<figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
```

## Step 25

After the `figure` element, add another `h3` element with the text `Top 3 things cats hate:`.

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg"
    alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."
  />
  <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
```

## Step 26

The code for an **ordered list** (`ol`) is similar to an **unordered list**, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

After the second `section` element's last `h3` element, add an ordered list with these three list items: `flea treatment`, `thunder` and `other cats`.

```html
<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
```

## Step 27

After the ordered list, add another `figure` element.

## Step 28

Inside the `figure` element you just added, nest an `img` element with a `src` attribute set to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg`.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" />
</figure>
```

## Step 29

To improve accessibility of the image you just added, add an `alt` attribute with the text `Five cats looking around a field`.

```html
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg"
  alt="Five cats looking around a field."
/>
```

## Step 30

After the last `img` element, add a `figcaption` element with the text `Cats hate other cats.`

```html
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg"
  alt="Five cats looking around a field."
/>
<figcaption>Cats hate other cats.</figcaption>
```

## tep 31

The `strong` element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.

In the `figcaption` you just added, indicate that hate is of strong importance by wrapping it in a `strong` element.

```html
<figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>
```

## Step 32

It is time to add a new section. Add a third `section` element below the second `section` element.

## Step 33

Inside the third `section` element add an `h2 `element with the text `Cat Form`.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Cat Form</h2>
</section>
```

## Step 34

Now you will add a web form to collect information from users.

After the Cat Form heading, add a element.

## Step 35

The `action` attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, `<form action="/submit-url"></form>` tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path `/submit-url`.

Add an `action` attribute with the value `https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo` to the `form` element.

```html
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo"></form>
```

## Step 36

The `input` element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like `img` elements, `input` elements are _self-closing_ and do not need closing tags.

Nest an `input` element in the `form` element.

```html
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
  <input />
</form>
```

## Step 37

There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the `type` attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.

Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the `type` attribute with the value `text` to the `input` element.

```html
<input type="text" />
```

## Step 38

In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the `action` attribute, you must give the text field a `name` attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: `<input type="text" name="email">`.

Add the `name` attribute with the value `catphotourl` to your text field.

```html
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" />
```

## Step 39

Placeholder text is used to give people _a hint_ about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, `<input type="text" placeholder="Email address">`.

Add the `placeholder` text `cat photo URL` to your `input` element.

```html
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" />
```

## Step 40

To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the `required` attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the `required` attribute. Instead, just add the word `required` to the `input` element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

```html
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
```

## Step 41

Use the `button `element to create a clickable button. For example, `<button>Click Here</button>` creates a button with the text `Click Here`.

Add a `button` element with the text `Submit` below the `input` element. The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's `action` attribute.

```html
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
<button>Submit</button>
```

## Step 42

Even though you added your `button` below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both `input` and `button` elements are **_inline elements_**, which don't appear on new lines.

You learned previously that the `button` submits the form by default, but you can explicitly add the `type` attribute with the value `submit` to make it clearer. Go ahead and do this to specify where this `button` should submit the form.

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

## Step 43

You can use **radio buttons** for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

Here is an example of a `radio` button with the option of cat: `<input type="radio"> cat`. Remember that `input` elements are **_self-closing_**.

Before the text `input`, add a `radio` button with the option `Indoor`.

```html
<input type="radio" /> Indoor
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
```

## Step 44

`label` elements are used to help associate the text for an `input` element with the `input` element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, `<label><input type="radio"> cat</label>` makes it so clicking the word `cat` also selects the corresponding radio button.

Nest your `radio` button inside a `label` element.

```html
<label><input type="radio" /> Indoor</label>
```

## Step 45

The `id` attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each `id` attribute's value must be unique from all other `id` values for the entire page.

Add an `id` attribute with the value `indoor` to the `radio` button. When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter.

```html
<label><input type="radio" id="indoor" /> Indoor</label>
```

## Step 46

Nest another `radio` button with the option `Outdoor` in a new `label` element. The new `radio` button should be placed after the first one. Also, set its `id` attribute value to `outdoor`.

```html
<label><input id="indoor" type="radio" /> Indoor</label>
<label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" /> Outdoor</label>
```

## Step 47

Notice that both `radio` buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one `radio` button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a `name` attribute with the same value.

Add the `name` attribute with the value indoor-outdoor to both `radio` buttons.

```html
<label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" /> Indoor</label>
<label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" /> Outdoor</label>
```

## Step 48

If you select the Indoor `radio` button and `submit` the form, the form data for the button is based on its `name` and `value` attributes. Since your `radio` buttons do not have a `value` attribute, the form data will include `indoor-outdoor=on`, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.

Add a `value` attribute to both `radio` buttons. For convenience, set the button's `value` attribute to the same value as its `id` attribute.

```html
<label
  ><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" />
  Indoor</label
>
<label
  ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
  Outdoor</label
>
```

## Step 49

The `fieldset` element is used to group related `inputs` and `labels` together in a web form. `fieldset` elements are **_block-level elements_**, meaning that they appear on a new line.

Nest the `Indoor` and `Outdoor` radio buttons within a `fieldset` element, and don't forget to indent the `radio` buttons.

```html
<fieldset>
  <label
    ><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" />
    Indoor</label
  >
  <label
    ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
    Outdoor</label
  >
</fieldset>
```

## Step 50

The `legend` element acts as a caption for the content in the `fieldset` element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

Add a `legend` element with the text `Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?` above both of the `radio` buttons.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
  <label
    ><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" />
    Indoor</label
  >
  <label
    ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
    Outdoor</label
  >
</fieldset>
```

## Step 51

Next, you are going to add some new form `input` elements, so add another `fieldset` element directly below the current `fieldset` element.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
  <label
    ><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" />
    Indoor</label
  >
  <label
    ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
    Outdoor</label
  >
</fieldset>
<fieldset></fieldset>
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

## Step 52

Add a `legend` element with the text `What's your cat's personality?` inside the second `fieldset` element.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
</fieldset>
```

## Step 53

Forms commonly use `checkboxes` for questions that may have **_more than one answer_**. For example, here's a `checkbox` with the option of tacos: `<input type="checkbox"> tacos`.

Under the `legend` element you just added, add an `input` with its `type` attribute set to `checkbox` and give it the `option` of `Loving`.

```html
<legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
<input type="checkbox" /> Loving
```

## Step 54

Add an `id` attribute with the value `loving `to the `checkbox` input.

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="loving" /> Loving
```

## Step 55

There's another way to associate an `input` element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a `label` element and add a `for` attribute with the same value as the `input` element's `id` attribute.

Associate the text `Loving` with the `checkbox` by only nesting the text `Loving` in a `label` element and place it to the right side of the checkbox `input` element.

```html
<input id="loving" type="checkbox" /> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
```

## Step 56

Add the `name` attribute with the value `personality` to the checkbox `input` element.

While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes.

```html
<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" />
<label for="loving">Loving</label>
```

## Step 57

Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The `id` attribute value should be `lazy` and the `name` attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.

Also add a `label` element to the right of the new `checkbox` with the text `Lazy`. Make sure to associate the `label` element with the new c`heckbox` using the `for` attribute.

```html
<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" />
<label for="loving">Loving</label>
<input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" /><label for="lazy"
  >Lazy</label
>
```

## Step 58

Add a final checkbox after the previous one with an `id` attribute value of `energetic`. The `name` attribute should be the same as the previous `checkbox`.

Also add a `label` element to the right of the new checkbox with text `Energetic`. Make sure to associate the `label` element with the new checkbox.

```html
<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" />
<label for="loving">Loving</label>
<input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" />
<label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
<input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" />
<label for="energetic">Energetic</label>
```

## Step 59

Like `radio` buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are `name` / `value` attribute pairs. While the `value` attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

Add a `value` attribute to each checkbox. For convenience, set each checkbox's `value` attribute to the same value as its `id` attribute.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
  <label
    ><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" />
    Indoor</label
  >
  <label
    ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
    Outdoor</label
  >
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
  <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
  <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving" />
  <label for="loving">Loving</label>
  <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy" />
  <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
  <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic" />
  <label for="energetic"> Energetic</label>
</fieldset>
```

## Step 60

In order to make a checkbox _checked_ or radio button _selected_ by default, you need to add the `checked` attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the `checked` attribute. Instead, just add the word `checked` to the `input` element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Make the `first` radio button and the first `checkbox` `selected` by default.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
  <label
    ><input
      id="indoor"
      type="radio"
      name="indoor-outdoor"
      value="indoor"
      checked
    />
    Indoor</label
  >
  <label
    ><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" />
    Outdoor</label
  >
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
  <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
  <input
    id="loving"
    type="checkbox"
    name="personality"
    value="loving"
    checked
  />
  <label for="loving">Loving</label>
  <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy" />
  <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
  <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic" />
  <label for="energetic"> Energetic</label>
</fieldset>
```

## Step 61

Now you will add a **footer section** to the page.

After the `main` element, add a `footer` element.

```html
  ---
    </main>
    <footer>
      </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 62

Nest a `p` element with the text `No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org` within the `footer` element.

```html
<footer>
  <p>No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org</p>
</footer>
```

## Step 63

Make the text `freeCodeCamp.org` into a link by enclosing it in an anchor (`a`) element. The `href` attribute should be set to `https://www.freecodecamp.org`.

```html
No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
```

## Step 64

Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the `body` element. All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the `body` element. However, other important information goes inside the `head` element.

Add a `head` element just above the `body` element.

```html
<head> </head>
<body>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <main></main>
</body>
```

## Step 65

The `title` element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

Add a `title` element within the `head` element. Its text should be `CatPhotoApp`.

```html
<head>
  <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
</head>
```

## Step 66

Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an `html` element. All other elements must be descendants of this `html` element.

Add the `lang` attribute with the value `en` to the opening `html` tag to specify that the language of the page is English.

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

## Step 67

All pages should begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

To complete this project, add this declaration as the first line of the code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
